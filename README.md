## Skaytacium's dotfiles and configs

### What?
Dotfiles are basically configurations and other things that you have stored for yourself.
Not much to write about it, except that these are mainly meant for me and might not work for everyone. Repo is licensed accordingly.

### Why?
Just got a new PC and shifting is hard so I made this.

### How?
I'm not going to be making an install script because I rarely shift computers so doing it manually is fine with me. A markdown file with all of the locations and some other notes is provided.

lmao I made an install script.

### And?
Thats mostly it. Keep in mind that there will soon be linux dotfiles too, for now there is just a markdown file in that folder saying TODO.

### Notes

Linux dotfiles now exist.
